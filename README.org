** 📦 Installation

*Install Emacs using Homebrew*:

I use the Homebrew Formula [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs+]] to install Emacs. Type the following
to install the current latest release of Emacs (30.1 as of writing):

#+begin_src bash
  brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  brew install emacs-plus
#+end_src

*Backup your existing configuration*:

If you already have configured Emacs before, backup your old configuration like so:

#+begin_src bash
  mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
#+end_src

*Clone this repository*:

To clone this repository into your Emacs configuration directory, type:

#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/fethalen/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

*Launch Emacs*:

The configuration will automatically bootstrap use-package and install
all required packages.
